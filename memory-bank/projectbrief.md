# Project Brief: MCP Server Development Assistant

## Core Goal

To develop an MCP (Model Context Protocol) Server that assists developers in writing *other* MCP Servers.

## Primary Functionality

The server will act as a knowledge base and reference tool, providing access to the structure and content of the official MCP documentation, stored locally. It will expose the documentation hierarchy and allow retrieval of specific sections via MCP tools and resources. This aims to streamline the development process for new MCP servers and ensure adherence to the protocol standards using a reliable local copy.

## Key Resources

- **Official MCP Documentation:** The primary source of information will be the content available at [https://modelcontextprotocol.io/](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/), particularly the "Quickstart" and "Introduction" sections.

## Scope

- **Phase 1 (Initial Focus):**
    - Establish local storage for documentation content (`.md` files) and structure (`structure.json`) within a `data/` directory.
    - Manually populate the initial structure and content based on `modelcontextprotocol.io`.
    - Implement an MCP Tool (`get_docs_structure`) to expose the documentation hierarchy stored in `structure.json`.
    - Implement dynamic MCP Resources to serve content from the local `.md` files based on the structure.
- **Phase 2 (Future Enhancements):**
    - Implement an MCP Tool (`trigger_docs_update`) to automatically scrape `modelcontextprotocol.io` and update the local `data/` directory (both structure and content).
    - Potentially add search capabilities or interactive examples.
    - Integrate with specific language SDKs (e.g., Python, C#).

## Success Criteria

- The server can accurately retrieve and present relevant information from the MCP documentation in response to developer queries or tool requests.
- The server demonstrably speeds up or simplifies the process of creating a new, compliant MCP server.
