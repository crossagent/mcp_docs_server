# Progress: MCP Server Development Assistant

## Current Status

- **Phase:** Phase 1 Implementation (Local Cache Setup & Basic Access)
- **Overall Progress:** Planning complete, Memory Bank updated with finalized plan. Starting Phase 1 implementation steps.

## What Works

- Basic project structure (`pyproject.toml`, `server.py` with `FastMCP` example) exists.
- Core Memory Bank files created and updated.
- `.clinerules` file created with project standards.
- Added dependencies (`requests`, `beautifulsoup4`) to `pyproject.toml` and installed them.
- Created scraper script `scripts/scrape_structure.py`.
- **Successfully generated `data/structure.json` using the scraper script.**

## What's Left to Build (Phase 1 Implementation Steps - Revised)

1.  **Create `data/` Directory Structure:** Create necessary subdirectories based on `data/structure.json` (e.g., `data/concepts`, `data/tutorials`, `data/quickstart`). *(Check if needed based on file list)*.
2.  **Create & Populate Content Files:** Manually create and populate initial `.md` files in `data/` corresponding to `data/structure.json` paths.
3.  **Implement `get_docs_structure` Tool:** Modify `server.py` to add this tool.
5.  **Implement Dynamic Resource Handling:** Modify `server.py` to serve content from local `.md` files based on URI.
6.  **Testing:** Run server and test tool/resources using an MCP client.

## Known Issues / Blockers

- None currently identified.

## Project Decisions & Evolution

- **Revised Decision:** Use local storage (`data/`) for content (`.md` files). Generate structure (`data/structure.json`) using a scraper script (`scripts/scrape_structure.py`) instead of manually creating it in Phase 1.
- **Decision:** Expose structure via `get_docs_structure` tool.
- **Decision:** Access content via dynamic MCP resources mapping URIs to local files.
- **Decision:** Populate content data manually in Phase 1.
- **Future Plan:** Enhance the scraper script or create a dedicated `trigger_docs_update` tool in Phase 2 for both structure and content updates.
- **Technology Choice:** Confirmed use of Python `mcp` library with `FastMCP`.
