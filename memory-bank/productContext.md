# Product Context: MCP Server Development Assistant

## Problem Statement

Developing new MCP Servers requires frequent reference to the official documentation to understand the protocol's structure, requirements, tool/resource definitions, and best practices. Constantly switching between the development environment and the documentation website can be disruptive and time-consuming. Developers might miss nuances or make errors if they rely solely on memory or incomplete examples.

## Solution: An Assistant MCP Server

This project aims to build an MCP Server that acts as an *assistant* for developers building *other* MCP Servers. It will provide context and information directly within the development workflow, leveraging the MCP protocol itself.

## How It Should Work

- **Information Source:** The server will maintain a local copy of the MCP documentation content (as Markdown files) and its structure (as a JSON file, e.g., `structure.json`) within a `data/` directory. This local copy is initially populated manually and can potentially be updated later.
- **Access Method:** Developers will interact with this assistant server using standard MCP tools (`use_mcp_tool`, `access_mcp_resource`) from their development environment (like VS Code with an MCP extension).
- **Functionality:**
    - **Structure Discovery:** Provide an MCP Tool (e.g., `get_docs_structure`) that returns the documentation hierarchy defined in the local `structure.json` file. This allows clients to understand the available documentation sections.
    - **Resource Access:** Provide dynamic MCP Resources. Clients use the structure information to request specific documentation sections via URIs (e.g., `mcp://docs/concepts/tools`). The server maps these URIs to the corresponding local Markdown files (e.g., `data/concepts/tools.md`) and returns their content.
    - **(Future) Update Trigger:** Potentially offer a tool to trigger an update of the local documentation cache from the official website.

## User Experience Goals

- **Seamless Integration:** Developers should be able to access MCP documentation and guidance without leaving their IDE.
- **Accuracy:** Information provided reflects the state of the local documentation cache. The accuracy depends on how up-to-date the cache is.
- **Reliability:** Accessing local files is generally more reliable and faster than fetching from the external website dynamically.
- **Efficiency:** Reduce the time developers spend searching for information, providing quick access to the locally cached docs.
- **Clarity:** Present information in a clear, concise, and easily digestible format suitable for quick reference during development.
