# Cline Rules: mcp-docs-server Project

## Communication Language

- **Preferred Language:** Please use Chinese (中文) for all communication and documentation unless otherwise specified.

## Python Development Standards

- **Mandatory Type Hints:** All Python function definitions **MUST** include type hints for all their parameters and return values. This aids static code analysis, improves code clarity, and reduces potential type errors.
  - *Example:* `def process_data(data: list[str], threshold: int) -> dict[str, int]:`

- **Recommended Docstrings:** While type hints are mandatory, clear docstrings are still highly recommended for functions with complex logic to explain their purpose, parameter meanings, return values, and any potential exceptions raised.
